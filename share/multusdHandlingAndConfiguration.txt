The multusd sucks in the /multus/etc/multusd.conf config file. which is the
only hard coded config.

The multusd.conf is also used from the php interface, as well as from every
single python process.

The most important config mentioned in the multusd.conf is the multusModulesConfigFile: 
/multus/etc/multusd_d/multusModules.conf

The multusModulesConfigFile provides all informations about the multusd child
processes and is edited by the php interface as the root user.
